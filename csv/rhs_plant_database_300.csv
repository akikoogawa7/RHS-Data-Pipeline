The compost should be kept continually moist to wet during the growing season by standing the container in a tray of lime-free water, such as rainwater. During the winter, plants enter a period of dormancy so keep just moist during the winter and do not stand the plants in water. If growing in a bog garden, plant in good light, but not in direct sunlight. For further information see Carnivorous plant cultivation","Propagation
