# RHS Database Pipeline
## A small project to kickstart my experimental data pipeline.

### Step by step process:
1. Extracted data using Selenium and Webdriver 
2. Cleaned data using Pandas Dataframe
3. Uploaded SQL database to Amazon RDS and images to S3 data lake.

### Motivation behind this project:
To collect as much information as possible on local plants in the UK and enable new commercial applications for horticulturists and gardeners.

### Credit and data ownership:
To the [Royal Horticultural Society](https://www.rhs.org.uk/) for making the plant database publically available.
